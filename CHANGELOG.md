# MsfsOfpLog - Speed-Based GPS Fix Recording Update

## Summary of Changes

### ‚úÖ New Features Implemented

1. **Speed-Based GPS Fix Recording**
   - GPS fixes are only recorded when aircraft speed > 45 knots
   - Prevents recording during taxi, ground operations, and parking
   - Ensures only flight data is captured

2. **Smart Flight State Tracking**
   - Distinguishes between pre-flight taxi and post-flight taxi
   - Only stops monitoring after aircraft has been airborne and landed
   - Prevents immediate monitoring stop during initial taxi phase
   - Shows flight phase in display: "TAXI (Pre-flight)", "AIRBORNE", "TAXI (Post-flight)"

4. **Automatic Takeoff and Landing Detection**
   - Records TAKEOFF event when aircraft accelerates above 45 knots
   - Records LANDING event when aircraft decelerates below 45 knots after being airborne
   - Displays takeoff üõ´ and landing üõ¨ events prominently in console and logs
   - Ensures complete flight tracking from gate to gate

5. **Enhanced Console Display**
   - Fixed console layout with current position at top
   - GPS fixes listed below current position (not appended to end)
   - Clean, organized monitoring interface
   - Real-time updates without scrolling console output
3. **Enhanced Mock Data**
   - Realistic flight simulation with proper speed profiles
   - Taxi phase: 15-35 knots (no GPS recording during pre-flight taxi)
   - Takeoff phase: 80-160 knots (GPS recording active)
   - Cruise phase: 170-190 knots (GPS recording active) 
   - Landing phase: 70-90 knots (GPS recording active)
   - Final taxi: 15-30 knots (monitoring stops automatically after landing)

### üîß Technical Implementation

#### Files Modified:
- `Services/GpsFixTracker.cs`: Added flight state awareness and `AddPassedFix()` method for manual fix recording
- `Program.cs`: Added takeoff/landing detection, flight state tracking, and enhanced console display with `DisplayCurrentStatus()` method
- `Services/MockSimConnectService.cs`: Enhanced flight simulation
- `Services/DataLogger.cs`: Fixed nullable reference warnings
- `README.md`: Updated documentation with new features

#### Key Code Changes:
```csharp
// In Program.cs - Flight state tracking with takeoff/landing detection
private static bool hasBeenAirborne = false;
private static bool takeoffRecorded = false;
private static bool landingRecorded = false;

// Automatic takeoff detection
if (!wasAirborne && isCurrentlyAirborne && !takeoffRecorded)
{
    var takeoffData = new GpsFixData { FixName = "TAKEOFF", ... };
    gpsFixTracker?.AddPassedFix(takeoffData);
}

// Automatic landing detection
if (wasAirborne && !isCurrentlyAirborne && hasBeenAirborne && !landingRecorded)
{
    var landingData = new GpsFixData { FixName = "LANDING", ... };
    gpsFixTracker?.AddPassedFix(landingData);
}

// Enhanced console display with fixed layout
private static void DisplayCurrentStatus()
{
    Console.Clear();
    // Display current position at top
    // Display GPS fixes list below with special icons for takeoff/landing
    // No more appending to console end
}

// In GpsFixTracker.cs - Manual fix addition for takeoff/landing
public void AddPassedFix(GpsFixData fixData)
{
    _passedFixes.Add(fixData);
    _passedFixNames.Add(fixData.FixName);
    FixPassed?.Invoke(this, fixData);
}
```

### üêõ Bug Fixes

1. **Fixed immediate monitoring stop**: Application no longer stops monitoring immediately when starting from ground/taxi
2. **Proper flight phase detection**: System now correctly identifies pre-flight vs post-flight taxi phases
3. **GPS fix recording logic**: Fixed to allow recording during landing roll and final approach phases
4. **Compiler warnings resolved**: 
   - Fixed async method without await in `MockSimConnectService.cs`
   - Fixed nullable reference type warning in `DataLogger.cs`

### üìã Testing Results

- ‚úÖ Build successful with **zero warnings**
- ‚úÖ Demo mode functional with realistic speed profiles
- ‚úÖ GPS fix recording only occurs during flight phases (not pre-flight taxi)
- ‚úÖ Monitoring continues properly through all flight phases
- ‚úÖ Automatic stop only occurs after aircraft has landed (post-flight taxi)
- ‚úÖ Both real and mock SimConnect services support new behavior

### üöÄ Ready for GitHub

The project is now complete and ready for GitHub repository creation with:
- All source code updated
- Comprehensive documentation
- MIT license
- Proper .gitignore
- Detailed setup instructions (GITHUB_SETUP.md)

### üéØ Usage

1. **Demo Mode**: `dotnet run -- -test`
2. **Real Mode**: `dotnet run`
3. **Start Monitoring**: Select option 3 from menu
4. **Flight Phases**: Monitor display shows current phase (Pre-flight taxi ‚Üí Airborne ‚Üí Post-flight taxi)
5. **Automatic Stop**: Monitoring ends automatically only after aircraft has landed and is taxiing
6. **Manual Stop**: Ctrl+C for immediate shutdown

The application now provides intelligent, speed-based GPS fix recording that automatically handles all flight phases from taxi to landing.
